    "\"In this notebook, we established a robust feature engineering pipeline to prepare the data for modeling, directly applying insights from the EDA. We addressed data quality by imputing missing values and scaling distributions, then engineered interaction features such as `ads_per_song` and `avg_song_length` to better capture user dissatisfaction and engagement depth. Finally, we implemented a stratified 80/20 train-test split and applied a preprocessing pipeline—using `StandardScaler` for numeric features and `OneHotEncoder` for categoricals—saving the vectorized datasets to ensure consistent inputs for the subsequent modeling phase.\""
